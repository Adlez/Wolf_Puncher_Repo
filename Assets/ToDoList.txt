Need to Do:
--------------------------
Fix The Mayor's Jump; Have her collide with the ground, have gravity bring her back down, don't rise forever
Fist velocity should be assigned values according to the pixel location of where the screen is pressed (in front of the mayor),
	this way The Mayor can punch in every direction in front of her
Enemy Spawn needs to work again
Enemy movement probably needs to be fixed
